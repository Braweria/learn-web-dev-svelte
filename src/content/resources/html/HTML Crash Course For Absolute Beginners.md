In this crash course I will cram as much about HTML that I can. This is meant for absolute beginners.
If you are interested in learning HTML but know nothing, then you are in the right place. We will be
creating a cheat sheet with all of the common HTML5 tags, attributes, semantic markup, etc. We will not
be focusing on CSS in this video. The CSS crash course will be released shortly after this one.
